# Cisco Live DevNet Workshop - DEVWKS-2061
The UCS PowerTool Suite is a collection of PowerShell compatible libraries that enable the administration, operation, and overall management of UCS Blade and Rack Server environments. Whether the environment is a collection of stand-alone servers managed with IMC PowerTool, Fabric Attached servers managed with UCS PowerTool or a group of UCS Manager domains managed with UCS Central PowerTool, there is a UCS PowerTool to meet your needs. 

The code in this repository is used during the Cisco Live DevNet Workshop DEVWKS-2061. This workshop exposes the secrets of UCS PowerTool with some tips and tricks along the way. It utilizes the UCS Platform Emulator and UCS PowerTool. You can use the code in this repo outside of the workshop by leveraging your own UCS Manager environment or in combination with DevNet learning labs and sandboxes.

For guided learning of the UCS PowerTool, DevNet Learning Lab Module [UCS PowerTool Introduction](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/ucs-powertool-introduction) is recommended.

* **Technology stack**: These are stand-alone code examples that can be run using the [DevNet UCS Management Sandbox](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/3323b7b0-b70b-4b1e-a929-6bdbff3aac8a?diagramType=Topology).

    - The [UCS Manager Platform Emulator](https://software.cisco.com/portal/pub/download/portal/select.html?&mdfid=286305108&flowid=79283&softwareid=284574017) can be used with this repository.

## Dependencies

UCS Manager PowerTool is required, download from [Cisco.com](https://software.cisco.com/download/home/286305108/type/284574017).
